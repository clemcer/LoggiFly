# Docker Swarm

LoggiFly does not monitor Swarm services directly, since the Swarm API is limited and does not integrate well with LoggiFly. Instead, it monitors the individual containers that belong to a configured Swarm service by recognizing the service name from Docker Swarm labels.

This means that LoggiFly has to be deployed as a global service on every node in the swarm cluster but it also means that you could monitor individual Swarm containers on only one node and you can get context about which node the container that has triggered a notification is running on.

To get context about which node the container that has triggered a notification is running on, you have to set the `LOGGIFLY_MODE` environment variable to `swarm`.

The `config.yaml` can be passed to each worker via [Docker Configs](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/config/) (_see example_).

The configuration pretty much stays the same except that you set `swarm_services` instead of `containers` or use the `SWARM_SERVICES` environment variable.

If normal `containers` are set instead of or additionally to `swarm_services` LoggiFly will also look for these containers on every node.

## Docker Compose

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  loggifly:
    image: ghcr.io/clemcer/loggifly:latest
    deploy:
      mode: global  # runs on every node
      restart_policy:
        condition: any
        delay: 5s
        max_attempts: 5
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro 
    environment:
      TZ: Europe/Berlin
      LOGGIFLY_MODE: swarm
      # You can use environment variables instead of a config.yaml if you want
      # SWARM_SERVICES: nginx,redis
      # GLOBAL_KEYWORDS: keyword1,keyword2
      # GLOBAL_KEYWORDS_WITH_ATTACHMENT: keyword3
      # For more environment variables see the environment variables section in the docs 
# Comment out the rest of this file if you are only using environment variables
    configs:
      - source: loggifly-config
        target: /config/config.yaml  

configs:
  loggifly-config:
    file: ./loggifly/config.yaml  # SET THE PATH TO YOUR CONFIG.YAML HERE

```

## Configuring the `config.yaml`


In the `config.yaml`, you can configure Swarm services to be monitored in the same way as containers.

```yaml
swarm_services:
  nginx:
    keywords:
      - error
      - regex: \timeout\b.* 
  redis:
    - keyword: critical
      attach_logfile: true
```

If both nginx and redis are part of the same compose stack named `my_service` you can configure that service name to monitor both:
```yaml
swarm_services:
  my_service: # includes my_service_nginx and my_service_redis
    keywords:
      - error
    keywords_with_attachment:
      - fatal
```

The `swarm_services` configuration is identical to that of `containers`, so for all available configuration options, refer to the [Containers section](./config_sections/containers) or the [Settings Overview](./settings-overview).
