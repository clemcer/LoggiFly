# Settings

This is how to define global settings in the config.yaml.
These are the default values:
  
```yaml
settings:          
  log_level: INFO                         # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  multi_line_entries: True                # Monitor and catch multi-line log entries instead of going line by line
  reload_config: True                     # Auto-reload config on changes
  disable_start_message: False            # Suppress startup notification
  disable_shutdown_message: False         # Suppress shutdown notification
  disable_config_reload_message: False    # Suppress config reload notification
  disable_container_event_message: False  # Suppress container start/stop notifications

  notification_cooldown: 5            # Seconds between alerts for same keyword (per container)
  notification_title: default         # Custom template for notification title
  action_cooldown: 300                # Cooldown (seconds) before next container action (min 60s)
  attach_logfile: False               # Attach log file to all notifications
  attachment_lines: 20                # Lines to include in log attachments
  hide_regex_in_title: False          # Hide regex pattern in notification title
  excluded_keywords:                  # List of keywords that will always be ignored in log lines. See the section below for how to configure these
  
```

## Notification Title

The setting `notification_title` requires a more detailed explanation:


When `notification_title: default` is set LoggiFly uses its own notification titles.
However, if you prefer something simpler or in another language, you can choose your own template for the notification title. 
This setting can also be configured per container and per keyword.

:::info
These are the keys that can be inserted into the template:
- `keyword` / `keywords`: _The keyword(s) that were found in a log line (they have the same value)_
- `container`: _The name of the container in which the keywords have been found_
:::

Here is an example:

```yaml
notification_title: "The following keywords were found in {container}: {keywords}"
```
Or keep it simple:
```yaml
notification_title: {container}
```

## Excluded Keywords

With this setting you can specify keywords that should _always_ be ignored. This is useful when you don't want to get notifications from irrelevant log lines.

`excluded_keywords` are set like this:

```yaml
settings:
  excluded_keywords:
    - keyword1
    - regex: regex-pattern1
    - keyword: keyword2
```
