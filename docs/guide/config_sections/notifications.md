# Notifications

You can send notifications either directly to **ntfy** or via **Apprise** to [most other  notification services](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki). 

If you want the data to be sent to your own **custom endpoint** to integrate it into a custom workflow, you can set a custom webhook URL. LoggiFly will send all data in JSON format.

You can also set all three notification options at the same time.

```yaml [ntfy]
notifications:                       
  ntfy:
    url: http://your-ntfy-server    # Required. The URL of your ntfy instance
    topic: loggifly.                # Required. the topic for ntfy

  apprise:
    url: "discord://webhook-url"    # Any Apprise-compatible URL (https://github.com/caronc/apprise/wiki)
```


```yaml [Custom Webhook]

::: details Webhook JSON Structure

If a **webhook** is configured LoggiFly will post a JSON to the URL with the following data. Note that the webhook feature might be expanded on and improved sometime in the future.

```yaml
{
  "unit_name": "...",
  "monitor_type": "...", # "container" or "swarm"
  "keywords": [...],
  "title": "...",
  "message": "...", 
  "host": "..."   # None unless multiple hosts are monitored
}

```
